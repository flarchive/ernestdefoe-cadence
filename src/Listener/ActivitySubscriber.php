 * `handle()` runs, or a closure. Its own docblock claims an array callable
 * works; the signature rejects it, and the failure is a TypeError while
 * extenders are being applied, which means a 500 on EVERY route rather than a
 * broken feature. Ten events the array way would have been ten classes; the
 * subscriber is the idiom Flarum inherits from Laravel for exactly this.
